	* Bug fix with my jQuery compatability code
	* Licenses added
	* testing variable added
	* more doc-work (it's pretty well done now.)
	* TODOs for planned functionality

	* More general coding in required
		* select by tag `form` instead of class
		* use selected form as context, so not all forms on page are validated
			when another is submitted, only the submitted form.

	* More generalization
		* automagically hide created error messages, so `display:none;` doesn't
			have to be specified in the css.
