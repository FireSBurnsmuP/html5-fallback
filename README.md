html5-fallback
=================

Forked from [toddmotto's required-fallback](https://github.com/toddmotto/required-fallback),
with added functionality for other attributes, starting with `placeholder` attributes,
but possibly with other additions as I find them necessary in other projects.

This project contains a robust HTML5 attribute fallback system, using client-side jQuery scripting.

Currently, the project supports fallbacks for the following attributes:
  * 'required' attribute, with client-side validation and the addition of required messages next to required fields.

Attributes currently planned:
  * 'placeholder' attribute, which will configurably add `title` attributes and/or captions beside or underneath the field

I plan to keep developing this as I need it, but feel free to use it as you see fit.
I'll figure out a license later, right now I'll get straight to coding.
